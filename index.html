          Online Gallery is a fast growing online art gallery, connecting people with art and artists they love.
          Online Gallery offers a beautiful selection of paintings, drawings, sculpture, design, jewellery and
          photography in
          various price ranges. It provides artists from around the world with an expertly curated environment in which
          to exhibit and sell their work. Online Gallery has various sections:

          For a very small fee artists may exhibit an art selection of their choice, with the possibility to communicate
          directly with art lovers. If the artist wishes, it is possible to build a larger profile with links to his/her
          own website. Our aim is to connect art lovers directly with the artists.

          It is also possible to let us do the work if you do not wish to spend time on selling your art yourself. Leave
          it to us. We are specialists in selling art and would be happy to include your work. Our portfolio includes
          large projects. Our system is transparent: Pay to play and no commissions over sold work. Clear and simple.

          We are based in Georgia, internationally known for its rich art culture, prominent design and
          expertise. With Online Gallery we are redefining the experience of buying and selling art by making it easy,
          convenient and welcoming for collectors, art lovers and artists alike.
